# Binary Search Tree (BST)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# BST INSERTION:
# ---------------

# 3 Things for insertion:

# 1. Main Tree variable 
# 2. Small values stored as LEFT child
# 3. Big values stored as RIGHT child
 
# eg: 11 20 13 8 53 31 21 10 50

# 11 is main tree root
# now 20 > 11 now 20 becomes right child to 11
# now 13 > 11, 20 > 11 now 13 becomes left child to 20
# now 8 < 11 now 8 becomes right child to 11
