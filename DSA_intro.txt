what is Data Structures
-----------------------
=> Data Structures are way of Storing data by that we can know how structualy data stored and how    allocate memory and we can get data.

=>Example Array we storing values in index format using index number easily we can get data this is a 
data Structure



what is Algorithms
------------------

=>Algorithms is a step by step process to store,get,update and delete data.

=>Many Algorithms is used for different tasks.

Internally Data Structures and Algorithms are work depend on each other:

=> how to store data the structre and its final output will depend on Data Structures
=> how to perform that task is depend on the Algorithms by step by step process.
